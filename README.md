First you should create [Spotify Developer Account](https://beta.developer.spotify.com)

You need your own `client_id` and `client_secret` and then you should complete a config.json file (config.json.sample is only sample)

### Running

```sh
$ npm i
$ npm run start:dev
```

Verify the application by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
http://localhost:8080
```
